A basic test application for Kha that displays gamepad events and some other information about connected gamepads.

Created in a few hours of work, don't expect the most polished application :)

**Note about the "Pressed Buttons" section:** Once a button was pressed, it will stay in the displayed list. A value of 0 usually means that the button is no longer pressed.
